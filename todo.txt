To Do
=====

Add import for:

  * MGS
  * MYCIGS
  * MYCPG
  * MGPG
  * FG

I think that all of these will require the match reports as the data source, **unless** there is 
some "statistics" page on fifa.com that I can pull from. In any case, FG will have to use the 
match reports, there is no escaping.

It might be a good idea to include some data verification, by comparing the data retrieved from 
various sources, e.g. compare GSS to match reports.
